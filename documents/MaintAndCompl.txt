## 3. Maintenance & Compliance Data

### MRO Vendor Network & Lead Times

Elevate’s maintenance database includes a **network of approved MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul) vendors** and typical **lead times** for parts and services. For each aircraft type and major component, the assistant has reference data on **which service centers or repair shops** are available (OEM service centers, authorized facilities, specialist shops for avionics, interiors, etc.), along with their locations, contacts, and operating hours. This allows quick direction for maintenance needs – e.g. if a client has an issue with a Honeywell TFE731 engine, the assistant knows nearby Honeywell MSP-approved facilities. Crucially, the data captures **average lead times for parts** by OEM and part category. In recent times, global supply chain issues have **doubled many factory part lead times**. Knowing this, the assistant can advise on realistic downtime. For example, if a Falcon 7X needs a windshield replacement, the system might flag: *“Note: windshield lead time \~4 weeks currently due to backlog. We’ll coordinate with Dassault’s Little Rock service center which has one in stock.”* The vendor network also tracks **parts pooling and exchange programs** – e.g. whether an exchange engine or APU is available to minimize downtime. Furthermore, Elevate’s data logs average **turnaround times for inspections** (like how long a 12-month or 500-hr inspection usually takes for each model) and **shipping times for components**. For instance, if a client’s aircraft is AOG with a faulty starter generator, the assistant can say: *“The part is in stock at our partner facility; average shipping 1–2 days, install time \~8 hours. Expect return to service by Thursday.”* The knowledge base also stores **MRO contact info and capabilities** – e.g. which shops can handle composite repairs on Gulfstreams or avionics upgrades on older jets. By referencing this, the assistant can recommend where to go for specific jobs (e.g. “For interior refurbishment, XYZ Completions in Springfield has capacity and a 4-week lead time for slot availability.”). Having insight into **parts lead-time averages** by OEM is especially useful in planning inspections: knowing that certain Dassault Falcon parts have been experiencing 2x delays, the assistant can proactively schedule orders or advise owners on expected costs if faster shipping or alternative sourcing is needed. In summary, Elevate’s maintenance network data ensures the assistant can swiftly coordinate repairs, predict downtime, and connect with the right vendors, all while setting accurate expectations about how long a fix might take given current industry supply conditions (e.g. *“hydraulic pump lead time \~10 days from Bombardier – or 3 days if we expedite from our parts pool”*). This keeps clients fully informed and helps minimize AOG time.

### Regulatory Libraries (Airworthiness Directives, Service Bulletins, Checklists)

Elevate maintains up-to-date libraries of **regulatory and manufacturer compliance documents** for each aircraft model in its fleet. This includes all relevant **FAA Airworthiness Directives (ADs)** and EASA equivalents, plus manufacturer **Service Bulletins (SBs)**, Service Letters, and inspection requirement checklists. The assistant can reference these to ensure an aircraft is in compliance or to plan upcoming maintenance. For example, if a client’s Phenom 300 is nearing 1,500 flight hours, the system knows a **mandatory inspection or AD** might be due (perhaps an AD requiring inspection of a specific part at 1,500 hours). ADs are **legally enforceable safety directives issued by regulators to correct unsafe conditions**, so the assistant will flag any that apply. It can say: *“AD 2023-05-10 requires inspection of the control cable tension by 1,200 hours – your aircraft is at 1,150, so it will need compliance at the next 100-hr.”* The data also notes which SBs have been incorporated. **Service Bulletins** are manufacturer-recommended modifications or checks (often optional unless mandated by an AD). The assistant can explain if an SB is recommended for reliability. For example: *“Gulfstream SB 100-32-285 (landing gear actuator upgrade) is available. Not mandatory, but we suggest it to improve performance; it may become required by AD in the future.”* If a user asks why a maintenance task is needed, the assistant can clarify if it’s due to an AD (*“required by FAA AD – hence mandatory”*) or an SB (*“optional, but recommended by OEM for safety enhancement”*). Additionally, Elevate’s library contains **inspection checklists per model** – essentially the manufacturer’s recommended maintenance schedule (100-hr, 200-hr, annual, 5-year, etc.). For instance, the system knows that many business jets have **hourly phased inspections** (e.g. every 200 or 300 hours) plus calendar-based checks (6-month, 12-month). As a general rule, FAR 91 requires an **annual inspection** for private operations and 100-hour inspections if for hire. Manufacturers often break down tasks into multiples of 100 hours (e.g. basic check at 100h, more at 300h, heavy at 600h, etc.) and major overhauls at specific hour or cycle limits. The assistant can thus inform an owner: *“Your Citation XLS is approaching 1,800 hours, which per the inspection program means the 1,800-hr/36-month tasks (comprehensive airframe inspection) are coming due. We should plan downtime for that within the next 2 months.”* By having these checklists and regulatory libraries on hand, the assistant helps clients stay **ahead of compliance**. It can even generate a mini schedule of upcoming requirements (e.g. *“Next due: 12-month/500-hr inspection in March, plus AD 2022-02 fuel line check by April”*). In sum, this knowledge ensures that any advice or scheduling the assistant gives keeps aircraft airworthy and in line with **FAA/EASA regulations and OEM maintenance programs**, preventing costly last-minute groundings. It also boosts confidence when clients ask detailed compliance questions – the assistant can reference the exact AD or rule behind an action, noting for example that *“Airworthiness Directive AD 2021-05-02 mandates replacement of that sensor within 50 flight hours due to a safety issue, so we must comply.”*

### Maintenance Program Enrollment (JSSI, MSP, ProAdvantage)

The knowledge base tracks which aircraft are enrolled in **hourly maintenance programs** like JSSI, Honeywell MSP, Williams TAP, or manufacturer programs such as Bombardier’s **ProAdvantage**. These programs significantly affect maintenance planning and costs, and the assistant uses this data to advise on coverage. If a client’s engines are on a program (e.g. **JSSI Engine Plan** or Pratt & Whitney ESP), the assistant knows most scheduled and unscheduled engine maintenance is pre-paid via hourly fees. It will remind the client that, for example, *“Your engines are covered under JSSI, so the upcoming hot-section inspection will be paid by the program (aside from per diem or removal labor).”* JSSI’s Tip-to-Tail program can cover airframe, engines, and APU all together – if an aircraft has this, the assistant can confidently say virtually all parts and labor for routine maintenance are included, stabilizing the budget. It also means in an unscheduled event (e.g. an engine failure), the program will pay for the overhaul or replacement, saving the owner potentially hundreds of thousands. The assistant will highlight this advantage when relevant: *“Because you’re on MSP Gold for the HTF7000 engines, the cost of that engine’s repair is covered – you’ll just pay the program’s deductible, if any.”* These programs are known to **enhance residual value and provide cost stability**, which the assistant can mention if a client is considering buying or selling an aircraft with program coverage. For instance: *“Enrollment in JSSI increases the aircraft’s value and makes operating costs predictable, as major items like engine overhauls (often 7-figure expenses) are pre-funded.”* The data includes typical terms: many engine programs have **transferable contracts** (new owner can assume it), and often an **80%–90% engine coverage level** (some older hours might not be covered if enrolled late). The assistant can advise on these nuances. Also, if an aircraft is *not* on a program, the assistant might flag expected costs: e.g. *“Note: This Hawker 800XP is not on any engine plan; a mid-life overhaul is due next year (\~\$500k per engine). We can enroll in JSSI now to mitigate that.”* Essentially, by knowing each tail number’s program status, Elevate ensures the assistant **accounts for maintenance coverage** when giving financial or operational guidance. For an enrolled aircraft, it will lean on the program (e.g. scheduling via program’s authorized service centers), and for a non-enrolled one, it might suggest enrolling if beneficial (with data points like average program cost vs. out-of-pocket costs, etc.). Programs like **JSSI**, for example, cover scheduled/unscheduled events for engines/APU with one hourly rate – JSSI even covers **Airworthiness Directives and Service Bulletins compliance** in some cases. So the assistant can reassure owners: *“Your ProAdvantage plan will cover that avionics upgrade SB since it’s included in the airframe program.”* This builds trust that the assistant is optimizing maintenance strategy and **saving costs wherever coverage exists**.
