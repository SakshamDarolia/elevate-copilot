Perfect. I’ll begin compiling extensive datasets for each of the eight categories you've listed, focusing on real-world data and industry standards. The report will center on North American operations and include:

* Airport and FBO specifications (major business aviation airports)
* Weather and NOTAM resources
* Flight performance planning data
* Charter pricing and scheduling inputs
* Maintenance vendors, regulations, and programs
* Market analytics for aircraft transactions
* Customer profiling and utilization benchmarks
* Legal contract templates and SLA definitions

I’ll notify you once the structured documents are complete.


# Elevate Aviation Data Resources – Comprehensive Knowledge Base

## 1. Real-Time Operational Data

### Airport & FBO Directory

Elevate’s system includes a global **Airport and FBO directory** containing key operational details for each airfield. For every airport, the directory provides the **ICAO and IATA codes**, location, and vital stats such as **runway count and length, surface type, elevation, and lighting**. It lists each airport’s **operating hours** and any special access rules (e.g. prior permission required or customs availability). Crucially, slot-controlled airports are flagged with **slot restriction** notes (for instance, London Heathrow being IATA Level 3 slot coordinated, or certain popular GA airports requiring reservation slots during peak events). The directory also details **FBO (Fixed Base Operator)** services on site – including available fuel types, hangar or tie-down facilities, crew lounges, catering, ground handling, and **applicable fees**. Elevate’s data draws on industry resources like the AOPA Airport Directory, which standardized over **36 common FBO fee categories** (e.g. ramp fee, landing fee, overnight parking, GPU, de-icing, etc.). These entries ensure transparency about potential charges and services at each destination. For example, an airport entry might show: *“KTEB (Teterboro, NJ) – Runways: 6,000 ft; Hours: 24/7 (voluntary quiet hours 2300-0600); No aircraft over 100,000 lbs MTOW; FBOs: Signature, Atlantic (both offer Jet-A, GPU, lav, crew cars); Fees: Landing \$*.\*\* per 1,000 lb, Parking $\* overnight (waived with fuel ≥ 100 gal).”\* Having such data allows the assistant to advise clients on suitable airports (e.g. if a client’s jet exceeds weight limits or if an airport closes at night) and to estimate handling costs in advance.

### Live Weather & NOTAM Feeds

Elevate integrates **real-time weather data and NOTAMs** to enhance operational advice. The assistant can pull the latest **METAR** reports (Meteorological Aerodrome Reports) and **TAF** forecasts for departure, destination, and alternate airports. These concise codes provide current conditions like wind, visibility, cloud ceiling, temperature/dewpoint, and altimeter. For example, a METAR might show low visibility or strong crosswinds, prompting the assistant to warn of possible approach minimums or turbulence. **TAFs** give predicted weather trends up to 24–30 hours ahead, invaluable for planning around evolving conditions. The system also includes **winds aloft** data (forecast winds and temperatures at cruise altitudes) and significant weather advisories: **AIRMETs** (for moderate hazards) and **SIGMETs** (for severe weather). An AIRMET Zulu for icing or Tango for turbulence will trigger the assistant to caution the user about in-flight icing levels or expected bumps. Meanwhile, a SIGMET warning of severe convective turbulence or volcanic ash will be highlighted as a serious hazard potentially requiring route changes. Real-time **NOTAM** feeds are also integrated – the assistant can check for Notices to Air Missions such as runway closures, navigational aid outages, or special airspace restrictions. This enables proactive rerouting or using alternates if, say, a destination’s main runway is closed for maintenance. **Runway condition codes** in winter NOTAMs (e.g. reporting braking action or contamination) are used to advise on landing distance and potential de-icing needs. By combining METAR/TAF weather with NOTAMs, the assistant can make context-aware suggestions: for example, if destination weather falls below minima or a sudden snow squall appears, it can recommend an alternate airport and note if de-icing will likely be needed due to precipitation and temperature. This real-time operational awareness helps Elevate’s clients make safe decisions (e.g. “Weather at Teterboro is below IFR landing minimums; we recommend Morristown as an alternate. Also, a NOTAM shows runway 6/24 closed at TEB, which could cause delays.”).

### Flight-Planning & Performance Calculators

Elevate offers integrated **flight-planning tools and performance calculators** to assist with technical mission planning. A **Weight & Balance** module contains each managed aircraft’s weight limits and CG envelope; the assistant can compute if a given passenger/cargo load and fuel quantity stay within limits. For instance, the user can ask if adding an extra passenger or bags is possible – the assistant will check against the max takeoff weight and CG range. The system also has **fuel burn calculators** that relate payload, fuel load, and range. This enables quick checks like how far a jet can fly with full seats versus ferrying with fewer passengers. There is also a **climb performance and takeoff/landing distance** tool. The assistant can input airport elevation, runway length, temperature (from METAR), and aircraft weight to verify takeoff feasibility. For example, a client considering a **Bombardier Global 7500** departing a short field can get an instant answer: *“At MTOW, the Global 7500 requires \~5,800 ft at sea level standard conditions, and around **8,679 ft** of runway at 5,000 ft elevation, 25°C. For a 5,000 ft runway, a weight reduction or fuel stop would be needed if temperatures are high.”* This kind of analysis is backed by manufacturer data and embedded performance graphs. The assistant can thus verify scenarios like *“Can a fully fueled Global 7500 depart Aspen (7,820 ft elevation, \~8,000 ft runway)?”* and provide a fact-based assessment with safety margins. Climb gradient calculators also help ensure obstacle clearance – e.g. if an airport has a steep second-segment climb requirement, the system checks the jet’s capability at the planned weight. All these planning tools allow Elevate to give **instant answers** on whether a mission is possible or how to adjust (less fuel or an intermediate fuel stop, payload reduction, etc.), rather than requiring lengthy manual computations. By leveraging real-time weather and aircraft data, the assistant can confidently say, for example: *“Yes, with 8 passengers the Citation X can depart Telluride’s 6,900 ft runway on a 20°C day under max gross – it will need \~6,000 ft, within limits. Climb gradient is marginal due to field elevation, but still meets Part 135 requirements.”* Such precise feedback elevates the planning accuracy and safety for clients.
