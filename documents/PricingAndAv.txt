## 2. Pricing & Availability Engines

### Dynamic Charter Rate API

Elevate’s pricing engine ties into a **Dynamic Charter Rate API** that reflects live market conditions for private jet charter. Instead of static hourly rates, the assistant always quotes **real-time pricing** based on aircraft type, routing, and current factors like fuel cost and demand. The API incorporates components such as **positioning or ferry charges** (if an aircraft must reposition empty to the pickup point), **peak day surcharges**, and current **fuel surcharges**. For example, if a client requests a holiday travel date (peak demand period), the assistant will automatically include any **peak-day surcharge** in the quote – many jet card and charter programs add 5%–40% surcharges on popular holidays and high-demand days. (Typically, a 20% uplift on the hourly rate is common on peak days, so a \$6,000/hr rate might become \$7,200/hr.) The system also factors in **fuel price fluctuations**: Elevate’s data monitors jet fuel (Jet-A) index prices. If fuel has spiked, a **fuel uplift fee** per hour or per mile is added. For instance, if the baseline fuel price is \$2.00/gal but current avg is \$6.20/gal, the API knows to add a surcharge reflecting that \$4.20/gal difference. (Such surcharges can add roughly **\$600–\$900 per flight hour** on large jets during high fuel price periods.) This ensures quotes remain aligned to operating costs. The pricing algorithm also considers **repositioning time**: if no suitable aircraft is at the origin, the quoted price will include the cost of flying one in (often charged at the same hourly rate as occupied flight). For example, if an empty leg from home base to pickup adds 1.5 hours, the client pays for that repositioning flight as well. Other dynamic inputs include **crew overnight costs**, landing/handling fees, and any **short-leg minimum fees** (e.g. many operators have a 2-hour minimum charge for midsize jets). By leveraging this API, the assistant’s quotes are **instantly updated** to market reality – if jet fuel jumps 10% or if it’s Super Bowl weekend (peak demand in the host city), the quote adjusts accordingly. This prevents unpleasant surprises and reflects the true “all-in” cost including taxes (like the 7.5% Federal Excise Tax in the US) and any specials. As a result, an Elevate client asking for a price on a short hop vs. a cross-country on short notice will get an accurate number. For example: *“A one-way midsize jet from Teterboro to Miami departing in 48 hours is approximately \$25,000 total, including repositioning and a 10% peak demand surcharge due to Art Basel weekend.”* The dynamic engine ensures such quotes are **data-backed**, incorporating industry variables (peak day rules, fuel costs, etc.).

### Aircraft Availability & Scheduling

Elevate maintains a **live scheduling system** for its fleet and crews, enabling the assistant to confirm availability or suggest alternatives in seconds. The **aircraft availability** data includes each managed jet’s calendar: upcoming booked trips, maintenance downtime, and crew assignments. When a client requests a given date/time, the assistant can instantly check if an appropriate aircraft is free and **meets the requirements** (size, range, amenities) at that time. If the preferred aircraft is already booked or in inspection, the system will either identify a similar substitute in the fleet or negotiate third-party lift. The scheduling engine also tracks **crew rosters and duty limits** to ensure legal pairing. Under FAA rules (Part 135), charter pilots can fly a maximum of 10 hours (multi-pilot crew) in a 14-hour duty day with at least 10 hours rest prior. Elevate’s data is aware of each crew’s recent duty times, rest period, and qualifications on each aircraft type. So if a client asks for a 10-hour round-trip on short notice, the assistant might respond: *“Available aircraft: Citation XLS *XYZ* is free and its crew is within duty limits for your 8:00am–6:00pm schedule. Captain A and FO B are assigned and legal (8 hours flight time planned, under the 10-hr limit).”* If the request would violate crew rules (e.g. an overnight flight with insufficient rest), the assistant can flag that and propose adjustments or a second crew. The system also considers **maintenance schedules** – e.g. if an aircraft is due for a 200-hr inspection next week or currently AOG awaiting a part, the assistant will avoid offering that tail number. It has data on MRO appointments and can therefore reply, for example, *“Our Gulfstream G450 is undergoing a scheduled inspection during that week, but we can provide a Challenger 650 instead, which is available.”* By having **fleet calendars and maintenance tracking** integrated, Elevate ensures immediate confirmation of availability or alternatives, improving response time to near real-time. The scheduling data even encodes **crew currency and type ratings** – the assistant will only pair crews qualified for the given aircraft and will note any special requirements (for instance, if a trip to London requires an EASA-qualified crew or if an airport like Aspen requires special training, it will check that the assigned crew meets those). Overall, this availability engine enables the assistant to *instantly confirm* if a requested charter can be done at the requested time and arrange the appropriate crew, or to highlight constraints (like *“Aircraft will be available but crew duty day will exceed limits unless departure is moved up by 1 hour”*). This level of detail provides clients immediate confidence in scheduling and avoids double-booking or last-minute surprises.
