## 5. Customer & Fleet Profiles

### Client Preferences & Profiles

Elevate’s CRM system contains detailed **client profiles** and preferences, enabling the assistant to personalize recommendations and remember important details for each customer. For every frequent flyer or aircraft owner, the profile logs their **past trip history** (routes frequently flown, typical passenger count, favorite hotels or FBOs, etc.), as well as specific preferences. This can include **cabin configuration preferences** (e.g. does the client prefer a forward galley closed off, or an aft stateroom setup on longer flights), catering likes/dislikes (such as preferred wines or dietary needs), and any **special accommodations** (for example, a client always travels with an assistance dog, or requires a certain brand of bottled water on board). The assistant uses this to proactively tailor trip planning. For instance, if a VIP client has a note “hates early morning departures,” the assistant will avoid proposing 5 AM departures and instead might suggest evening prior or a more comfortable schedule. If another client’s profile indicates membership in a **loyalty program or jet card hours balance**, the assistant will incorporate that: *“You have 10 hours remaining on your Elevate JetCard, which can be applied to this trip for a discount.”* The profiles also mark any **pet travel or medical needs** (“Client travels with a small dog in cabin – provide pet safety harness and notify FBO” or “Passenger has peanut allergy – ensure catering is nut-free”). Because this data is integrated, the assistant can respond to requests in a highly customized way. For example, if a customer asks for a flight to The Bahamas, the assistant might recall *“Last time you flew there in March, you requested fresh sushi on board and an in-flight Wi-Fi streaming package – shall we arrange the same?”* Similarly, **preferred FBOs or airports** are stored – some clients might prefer smaller executive airports over major hubs for convenience. The assistant will use those defaults unless told otherwise (*“We’ll plan to use KDAL (Dallas Love Field) as usual instead of DFW, for your convenience.”*). If a client has a **call sign or tail number preference** (some owners prefer their own aircraft when available), the system notes that and will first check their fleet before offering charter substitutes. **Personalization extends to notifications and style** – the profile might say a client likes a phone briefing a day before the flight, or prefers succinct text messages only. The assistant adapts its communication style accordingly. Moreover, for clients who frequently travel a certain **route**, the assistant can proactively mention known preferences: e.g. *“I recall you often ask for a specific chauffeur in NYC – would you like me to arrange Mr. Smith to pick you up at Teterboro again?”* All these small touches, driven by stored profile data, lead to a seamless experience. The assistant essentially acts as a high-end concierge who “knows” the client personally – without the client having to repeat themselves each time. Elevate also flags VIP anniversaries or milestones; if a client has completed 100 flights or has a birthday trip, the assistant knows to suggest something extra (like a special champagne on board, perhaps drawing from **testimonials** where similar gestures were appreciated). By leveraging client profiles, Elevate ensures every interaction is **highly tailored**, enhancing satisfaction and trust.

### Fleet Utilization Metrics

For aircraft owners and management clients, Elevate tracks comprehensive **fleet utilization metrics** to help them benchmark and optimize their operations. The assistant has access to data on the **typical annual flight hours** for similar aircraft under management, the breakdown of flight purposes (business vs. personal vs. positioning), and other efficiency indicators. Industry averages show that a wholly-owned business jet might fly around **300–400 hours per year** (if solely for owner use, often closer to 200-300), whereas aircraft that are also chartered can fly more, sometimes 500+ hours. The assistant can use these figures to contextualize a client’s usage. For example: *“Your Gulfstream flew 250 hours last year. The fleet average for similar large jets in managed service is about 330 hours/year. If your utilization is lower, we could consider offering it for charter a bit more to offset costs if you’re open to that.”* In fact, data from JetNet indicates \~330 hours/year is average for bizjets in 2024, and fractional/shared jets can log up to 800–1,300 hours/year. The assistant will mention such contrasts to highlight wear-and-tear and maintenance implications (aircraft used 1,000 hours/year will hit major inspections sooner). **Mission mix** analytics are also stored. For instance, the assistant can tell an owner: *“70% of your aircraft’s flight hours last year were personal/leisure, and 30% business-related. Also 15% of total time was positioning (ferry flights). This is in line with our other clients – fleet average reposition time \~10–15%.”* If the repositioning percentage is high, it might suggest strategies to reduce it (like basing the aircraft closer to typical departure points, or smarter trip chaining). Elevate also collects **benchmark costs per hour** and other KPIs. If an owner’s jet is spending too long on ground maintenance or if crew overtime is higher than norm, the assistant can flag that using metrics. It can say: *“Your utilization of 250 hrs with 2 full-time pilots yields \~125 hrs per pilot annually – industry standard is closer to 330 hrs/pilot. We may be able to deploy crew for additional charter flying or adjust staffing.”* Additionally, by tracking **utilization vs. maintenance**, the assistant might note an aircraft flying well below potential (less than 150 hours/year) could consider **charter revenue offset** – data shows charter can offset up to 80% of fixed costs in best cases. It will present realistic expectations: *“Chartering your jet an extra 100 hours could generate roughly \$500k gross revenue, offsetting maybe 50% of your annual operating cost, based on current charter rates and an 80/20 owner-operator revenue split.”* On the other hand, if an aircraft is flying a lot (say 500+ hrs/year), the assistant might suggest whether adding a relief crew or doing more frequent inspections is prudent, comparing to how **high-utilization charter fleets** manage 800+ hrs with multiple crews. These metrics essentially allow owners to **benchmark**: are they under-using an asset, or overextending it, relative to peers? The assistant can produce a concise report of key figures: annual hours, number of flights, average stage length, percentage of nights away, etc., and compare them with Elevate’s anonymized fleet averages and NBAA benchmarks. For example: *“Your average mission is 2.1 hours with 5 passengers. The industry average for super-midsize jets is \~2.5 hours per leg with 4-5 pax, so you’re very typical.”* This contextual information helps management clients make data-driven decisions (maybe they’ll realize they can downsize or upsize their aircraft, or adjust their ownership strategy). Thus, through robust utilization data, Elevate not only manages operations but becomes a consultative partner in optimizing the owner’s use of their aircraft.
