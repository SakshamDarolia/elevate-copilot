## 6. Legal & Contractual Templates

### Charter Agreements & Terms of Carriage

Elevate provides the assistant with standard **charter agreement templates** and a breakdown of key contractual clauses so it can guide clients through the fine print. These cover areas like booking and payment terms, cancellation policies, liability, and passenger conduct rules (terms of carriage). For instance, if a client is about to sign a charter contract, the assistant can summarize: *“Our standard charter agreement includes a **Force Majeure** clause: neither Elevate nor the carrier is liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond control (e.g. extreme weather, airport closures). This means if a blizzard shuts the airport, neither party is in breach – we’d work to reschedule without penalty.”* The assistant knows to emphasize Force Majeure because it can significantly impact obligations during unforeseen events. It will also explain **liability and insurance clauses**: typically, the operator maintains a certain amount of liability insurance, and the client’s rights to claim are limited to intent or gross negligence scenarios. For example, *“The contract’s liability clause ensures the operator carries \$X million insurance. It also limits each party’s liability for indirect damages. Essentially, you’re covered by their policy in the unlikely event of an accident, but they don’t cover things like lost business opportunity due to a delay.”*

Another crucial section is **Cancellation policy**. The assistant has data on the cancellation terms and penalties, which often depend on how far in advance the trip is canceled. For instance: *“If you cancel more than 72 hours before departure, typically a nominal admin fee or your deposit is forfeited. Within 72 hours, the contract may require up to 50% of the trip cost, and within 24 hours or no-show, up to 100% is chargeable.”* It will check Elevate’s specific terms to be precise. The assistant might add context, such as *“These cancellation fees cover positioning costs or lost opportunity to charter the jet to others – always important to be aware to avoid surprise charges.”* The standard agreement likely also covers things like **pets, hazardous materials, and special requests** under terms of carriage. The assistant can answer questions like “Can I bring my dog?” – citing the clause that pets are allowed with prior notice and in carriers, and noting any cleaning fee or damages responsibility. Similarly, if a client asks about bringing extra luggage or firearms or oxygen tanks, the assistant can refer to the contract’s rules (e.g. “no dangerous goods without consent” etc.).

**Payment terms** are explained too: e.g. requirement for full payment before flight, or deposit schedule. And it can mention any escrow or cancellation refund processes. If a dispute arises, the assistant knows the **dispute resolution** clause – many charter contracts have arbitration or specify governing law. It might say: *“In the event of a dispute, our contract calls for arbitration under New York law – meaning an arbitrator would resolve issues rather than court. This tends to be faster and private.”*

The assistant is effectively prepared to **walk clients through the contract highlights** in plain language, so they feel comfortable. It uses the template as reference and can even share sample wording if needed (except for sensitive or lengthy legal text, it will summarize). For example, it might highlight the **cancellation and refund** section if a client is worried about COVID or other issues affecting travel, or the **force majeure** section during hurricane season. By referencing the actual contract structure, the assistant ensures consistency: it will speak in terms that match Elevate’s policies (like using the same definitions for terms such as “owner’s carriage” or “charterer”).

One common question might involve **liability limits** for luggage or delays. The assistant could answer: *“Our charter terms limit the carrier’s liability for baggage loss to \$X per passenger, consistent with standard industry practice. We always recommend travel insurance for high-value items.”* It can also clarify **passenger responsibilities** – like needing valid passports/visas, complying with crew instructions, etc., which are typically stated in the terms of carriage. Because this is all in the knowledge base, the assistant can quickly address any contract-related query with confidence. In summary, by having formal charter T\&Cs at hand, Elevate’s assistant demystifies the paperwork, ensuring clients understand their rights (e.g. when they’re entitled to a refund) and obligations (e.g. showing up on time, not bringing prohibited items) before they sign or fly.

### Management & Service Agreements

For aircraft owners using Elevate’s **Aircraft Management services**, the assistant is equipped with the templates and common clauses of the management agreements. These contracts outline the scope of services Elevate provides (crew management, maintenance oversight, charter revenue sharing, etc.), and important terms like fees, contract length, and termination. The assistant can explain the **management fee structure**: *“Elevate charges a fixed monthly management fee (e.g. \$X,000 for a heavy jet) which covers administrative oversight, crew recruitment/training, scheduling, etc. On top of that, direct operating costs (fuel, maintenance, landing fees) are passed through at cost to you.”* It can mention if Elevate passes along any negotiated discounts on fuel or maintenance. In fact, good management agreements stipulate that all third-party discounts or rebates benefit the owner (so the management co. shouldn’t mark up fuel or services). The assistant will highlight if that’s in Elevate’s contract: *“Our agreement guarantees that any fuel or handling discounts we secure are passed 100% to you, the owner. Transparency is key – you won’t pay more than actual cost.”*

The contract’s **term and termination clauses** are often of interest. The assistant can explain that typically it’s a one-year term auto-renewing, but with provisions for early termination. It would advise an owner to negotiate the ability to terminate on reasonable notice (30-90 days) without hefty penalties. For example: *“We allow termination with 60 days’ notice after the first year. If you needed out sooner due to a sale or other reason, we have clauses that if the aircraft is sold or if we lose our charter certificate, you can cancel immediately without penalty.”* It will also note protections like requiring Elevate to **return the aircraft and all records** promptly upon termination (no “hostage jet” scenario).

**NDA and confidentiality** clauses are standard – the assistant can reassure that Elevate includes a mutual NDA to protect the owner’s privacy and any sensitive info (passenger lists, etc.). If asked, it can summarize: *“Yes, our agreement has a strict confidentiality clause. We won’t disclose your tail number or travel details, and we expect the same confidentiality from you regarding our pricing and practices.”*

Another common point is **crew employment and poaching**. The assistant might explain that in Elevate’s agreement, the management company employs the crew, and if the owner terminates and takes the crew, there might be an obligation to cover accrued vacation or even a clause about not soliciting employees for a certain period. It could say: *“Should you end the agreement and hire the crew directly or with another company, the contract stipulates you cover any owed vacation pay and standard severance for those pilots. This ensures the crew is treated fairly if transferred.”* This alerts the client to consider that cost when terminating.

**Fee structures** beyond the monthly fee can include start-up fees (like a conformity inspection fee to put the jet on Elevate’s charter certificate). The assistant will outline those: *“Before operation, we do a conformity check (usually a one-time fee, e.g. \$Xk) to ensure the aircraft meets all Part 135 requirements. We also can assist with prebuy or delivery for new aircraft for a set fee plus travel expenses.”* And it might mention if the monthly fee is fixed or subject to periodic CPI adjustments (some contracts allow an annual increase tied to inflation).

**Charter revenue sharing** is another critical part. If Elevate charters the owner’s aircraft, the contract defines how revenue is split. Many agreements give \~85% of charter gross to owner, 15% to management as commission, or similar. The assistant can confirm: *“Our charter management option splits revenue 80/20 in your favor. You get 80% of charter rental income, we retain 20% for facilitating the charter and handling logistics.”* It can also clarify cost responsibilities in charter ops – often the owner still pays for maintenance and gets reimbursed from charter revenue after management take. It will articulate those mechanics clearly.

Finally, **key owner protections** in the contract are explained: things like owner’s approval required for any major expense above a threshold (say >\$10k), ensuring the management company can’t make large modifications or repairs without consent. Or that the management company must maintain required insurance levels and list owner as additionally insured. The assistant ensures the owner knows these: *“We will not perform any improvement or incur any single expense over \$10,000 without your approval, per the contract. You also have final say on any charter use – if you want the plane available only certain days or not used by certain clients, that can be arranged.”* It also mentions regulatory compliance responsibility: Elevate (as the operator) handles all FAA/DOT compliance for flights and crew as per the contract, so the owner can be hands-off in that regard.

By having this template knowledge, the assistant can answer both general and pointed questions about management agreements. From *“What am I paying each month and what’s included?”* to *“How can I exit if I’m unhappy?”* or *“Do I get a say in which charters my plane flies?”*, the assistant provides **candid, informative answers** drawn from the contract and industry norms. This way, owners fully understand the partnership framework with Elevate and feel secure in signing on.
