## 4. Sales & Market Analytics

### Pre-Owned Market Transactions

Elevate’s sales analytics database contains extensive **historical transaction data** for pre-owned aircraft, which the assistant uses for **valuations and market insights**. This includes records of asking prices vs. final sold prices, time on market, and depreciation trends for various models by year. For instance, the data might show that a 5-year-old super-midsize jet (like a Challenger 300) typically sells for \~70% of its new price, whereas after 10 years it’s \~50%. The assistant can reference these **depreciation curves**: e.g. *“Large cabin jets tend to depreciate \~26% over the first five years, while small jets lose around 23–25% in that period, then the annual depreciation slows.”* It also knows factors like **airframe hours and engine cycles** influence value – high-usage aircraft sell at a discount. If a client is selling or buying, the assistant can provide a data-driven estimate: *“Global 6000 s/n 9xxx with 1,200 hours is valued about \$25M in today’s market. Similar aircraft sold in last 6 months ranged \$24–26M depending on engine programs and avionics upgrades.”* Historical data on **ask vs. sell spread** is helpful for negotiation; e.g. maybe on average sellers ask 10% above the price they actually accept. The assistant might advise a buyer: *“The asking price is \$10.5M, but recent transactions of this model average \~7% below ask, so an offer around \$9.8–10.0M could be reasonable.”* The dataset includes **depreciation curves by year and usage** – for example, it might reflect that a typical business jet flown 400 hours/year retains value better than one with 800 hours/year (excess hours diminish value faster). It can quantify that: each additional 100 hours per year above average might knock X% off the value. The assistant can illustrate total cost of ownership by combining depreciation plus operating cost, helping sellers and buyers see the big picture. **Regional differences** are also captured; e.g. aircraft in North America might fetch different prices than in Asia or Europe due to demand. If relevant, the assistant will mention market conditions: *“Inventory for midsize jets is low right now (post-2021 surge in demand), leading some models to *appreciate* or hold value abnormally – e.g. 2020 models selling near their new price.”* Moreover, the knowledge base has **historical price indices** (like JetNet or Vref data) showing how specific models’ values have trended over time, and how economic events affect them (such as the dip in 2020, rapid rise in 2021-22, etc.). For a client asking about selling timing, the assistant could say: *“Pre-owned inventory is increasing and prices have started softening by \~5% in the last two quarters, so it may be prudent to list sooner to capture higher value.”* All these insights come cited with real data points from the past (for credibility). When needed, the assistant will provide example comparables: *“A 2008 Citation XLS with 3,500 hours sold for \$4.2M last month, whereas ones with engine programs fetched \~\$300K more.”* By leveraging transaction data, Elevate ensures its advice on buying or selling aircraft is **grounded in market reality** and not just rule-of-thumb – giving clients confidence in their decisions.

### Financing & Insurance Products

Elevate’s knowledge base also covers typical **financing and insurance metrics** to help clients evaluate total ownership cost. On financing, the assistant knows current **interest rate ranges, loan terms, and typical loan-to-value (LTV) ratios** for aircraft loans. For example, as of 2025, well-qualified buyers might get fixed interest rates around 5.5–8.5% with loan terms of 5–15 years. Lenders typically require around **20% down (80% LTV)** on modern business jets, though some banks go up to 90% LTV for newer aircraft with strong financials. The assistant can explain: *“Banks usually finance 70–90% of the aircraft’s value for newer jets. So for a \$10M jet, expect to put \$1–3M down and finance the rest.”* It will also note that loan terms often align with the asset’s age (older aircraft may get shorter terms or higher rates). The knowledge base includes guidelines such as NBAA’s finance primer: e.g. minimum credit score \~700+, substantial liquidity (perhaps 2-3x annual debt service), and possible personal guarantees. If a client asks about lease vs. buy, the assistant can outline **operating leases** vs. **finance leases**: operating leases may require only a security deposit and have monthly payments, with the lessor owning the asset (like “renting” the jet), whereas finance leases are akin to loans with a residual buyout. It might mention current lease trends as well. On the **insurance** side, Elevate tracks typical hull and liability premium costs for various aircraft categories and uses. The assistant knows, for instance, that for a corporate-operated jet with experienced crew, **annual hull insurance premiums** are often on the order of **0.3%–0.5% of hull value** in the current soft market. (Indeed, one source notes about \$30k per year for a \$10M aircraft, which is \~0.3%.) It can cite industry averages: *“Insurance is running relatively low now; one can insure a \$10M jet for around \$25k–\$35k/year with \$200M liability coverage. That’s roughly 0.3% of hull value for the premium.”* (Notably, some publications quote averages of “14% of hull value,” but that appears to be a misprint – actual premiums are a small fraction of hull value, not double-digit percent, as real examples illustrate.) The assistant will clarify that **liability coverage** (commonly \$100M–\$300M for corporate jets) is usually included and does not drive cost as much as hull value and pilot experience. It can also discuss how insurance costs have trended – e.g. after a period of low premiums, insurers might be raising rates or requiring higher pilot experience due to recent losses. If a client is budgeting ownership, the assistant combines financing and insurance: *“For a \$5M loan at \~6% over 10 years, monthly payment is about \$55k. Insurance might be \~\$15k/year. So, roughly \$680k/year for loan+insurance.”* Additionally, it can mention **financing structures** like floating vs fixed rates, the option of interest-only periods, and how interest rate changes impact payments. For instance: *“At 6% interest, each \$1M financed costs about \$8,330 per month; at 8%, it’s \$9,770 per month, so rising rates can significantly increase cost.”* Overall, by having these **financial benchmarks**, Elevate’s assistant ensures clients consider not just purchase price but the ongoing costs of capital and risk. This helps them make informed decisions such as comparing leasing rates to loan costs, or understanding that an older, cheaper jet might face higher insurance and maintenance outlays that offset the lower acquisition price.

### Market Trend Reports

To advise clients on timing and strategy, Elevate’s knowledge base includes **market trend reports and industry stats**. This covers data like quarterly business jet **delivery numbers, backlogs, and regional demand trends**. For example, GAMA (General Aviation Manufacturers Association) reports are stored, allowing the assistant to cite that *“Worldwide business aircraft deliveries rose 18% in Q1 2025 vs Q1 2024, with 627 airplanes delivered in the first quarter of 2025. Gulfstream led in large-cabin shipments (36 jets), with Bombardier and Embraer each delivering 23 in that quarter.”* This indicates a healthy production trend. **Backlog information** for new models is also tracked – e.g. if Embraer announces a \$7.6B executive jet backlog in 2025 (up 3% quarter-over-quarter), the assistant can tell a buyer that new aircraft slots are sold out for X years. Such backlog and waitlist data are critical for clients deciding whether to order new or buy used. The assistant might say: *“The factory backlog on the G700 extends into 2027, so if you order new, expect a 2+ year wait. This strong backlog also buoys the pre-owned values.”* Another trend captured is the **“perimeter rule” or performance gap analysis by region** – for instance, noting that certain regions lack direct city-pair range coverage. As an example, if in Asia there’s increasing demand for longer-range jets to connect city pairs without stops, the assistant can highlight *“market gap: ultra-long-range jets are in higher demand in Asia-Pacific due to distances, driving up their values.”* It also tracks **quarterly price indices** – e.g. if over the last year, light jet prices fell 5% while large jets rose 3%, it will know. These are used to advise sellers: *“MarketTrend Q3 report shows inventory levels rising and average asking prices down \~4% from their peak in Q1. Selling sooner than later might avoid further softening.”* Conversely, if a client is buying, it might identify an opportune time if certain segments are oversupplied (leading to better deals). Elevate’s data also includes **production and delivery forecasts**: for example, if new models (like a rumored Gulfstream “G800”) are coming, potentially affecting used values of older models. The assistant keeps tabs on OEM announcements, certification of new aircraft, and even factors like **pilot shortage or economic indicators** that could influence usage. Additionally, specialized reports on *“runway and range gaps”* inform if a client’s needs align with an emerging trend – e.g. more demand for short-field capable jets in mountainous regions, or more demand for long-range in emerging markets. Summaries of **market research** (like JetNet iQ or OEM market outlooks) are available for the assistant to quote. For instance: *“According to Bombardier’s market outlook, business jet fleets in North America are expected to grow \~2-3% annually through 2030, with large cabin jets representing the fastest-growing segment.”* These insights let the assistant go beyond immediate Q\&A and provide **strategic context** – helping sellers decide when to sell, buyers what to buy (or whether to wait for a new model), and owners how their asset is performing relative to market. Essentially, Elevate arms the assistant with a **finger on the pulse of the bizav market**, so every recommendation is backed by current industry intel and trend analysis.
