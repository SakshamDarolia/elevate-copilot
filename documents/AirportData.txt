## 8. Airport Data and Constraints (North America Focus)

Elevate’s knowledge repository includes specific data on major airports and critical operational constraints, especially focusing on North America’s busy airfields where many clients fly. This allows the assistant to advise on airport choices and operational limitations.

### Major Airport Codes and Traffic Highlights

Many Elevate clients use busy hubs like **MIA (Miami Intl)**, **LAX (Los Angeles Intl)**, **LAS (Las Vegas McCarran)**, **MCO (Orlando Intl)**, etc., so the assistant is prepared with key info on these. For each, it knows the codes, approximate traffic levels, and GA facilities:

* **MIA – Miami International** (KMIA) is one of the top 3 U.S. international gateways, with heavy commercial traffic (\~45 million passengers/year pre-2020). It has multiple FBOs (Signature, Atlantic) for private flights, but given congestion, many private flyers opt for nearby **OPF (Opa-locka Executive)** which is less busy and GA-friendly. The assistant might suggest OPF or **FXE (Fort Lauderdale Executive)** if appropriate, noting MIA’s congestion and higher fees. Miami area airports have no slot restrictions, but during events (Art Basel, etc.) high demand can cause ramp space issues.

* **LAX – Los Angeles International** (KLAX) is among the world’s busiest airports (over 88 million pax/year typical). Private jets can and do operate at LAX (there are two FBOs, e.g. Signature West), but LAX has congestion and extended taxi times. The assistant often recommends **KVNY (Van Nuys)** – the busiest GA airport in the US with \~200,000 operations/year – as an alternative for LA-bound clients, since Van Nuys is dedicated to private aviation (and indeed famed in industry). LAX has no official GA slot restriction, but noise abatement procedures apply late at night and certain runways may be prioritized for commercial traffic. If a client insists on LAX, the assistant will advise planning for possible ground delays due to its traffic.

* **LAS – Harry Reid International (Las Vegas)** (KLAS, formerly McCarran) is very popular for private jets, especially on weekends. It handles \~50 million passengers/year plus significant GA volume. There are two main FBOs (Atlantic and Signature) right on the field. LAS doesn’t have slot requirements generally, but during big conventions or fights (e.g. CES, Mayweather fights), a reservation system might be temporarily in place due to parking saturation. The assistant will recall that **over 800 private flights** might swarm Vegas on a big weekend, so booking space early is key. Nearby alternatives include **KHND (Henderson Executive)** or **KVGT (North Las Vegas)** which the assistant can suggest if LAS ramps are full. Also, LAS is open 24/7 with no noise curfew – beneficial for late-night departures after events.

* **MCO – Orlando International** (KMCO) is a large commercial airport (\~50 million pax/yr) with a couple FBOs for GA. It’s generally not slot-controlled, but it’s busy due to Disney tourism. The assistant might mention the choice of using **KORL (Orlando Executive)** which is much closer to downtown Orlando and exclusively GA. MCO might make sense if the private flight is connecting directly to an airline flight or needs customs (MCO has full customs, whereas Exec might require arrangements for international arrivals). Orlando has afternoon thunderstorms in summer that can cause ground stops – the assistant could note typical weather delays rather than regulatory constraints.

Beyond those specific airports, the knowledge base highlights important **constraints** at certain NA airports:

* **Slot-controlled or PPR (Prior Permission Required) airports**: e.g. **KDCA (Washington Reagan National)** is unique – GA flights must obtain a TSA waiver under the DASSP security program and slots are limited. The assistant will inform clients that flying into DCA requires advance clearance and slot reservations (only certain gateway airports and armed security on board, etc.). Often, private flights use KIAD or KHEF instead for DC access if they can’t meet DCA’s requirements.

* **Noise Curfews**: Several airports have local noise rules. For instance, **KSNA (John Wayne Airport, Orange County)** has one of the strictest: no commercial operations 2200–0700 (0800 Sun) and even GA jets essentially face a noise-based curfew 2200–0700. While technically GA can operate if quiet, in practice virtually no jets depart SNA after 10pm. The assistant will warn: *“Orange County has a hard curfew; last departure for jets is 10pm local, so we must schedule earlier or use another airport at night.”* Nearby **KLGB (Long Beach)** also has night restrictions (2200–0700 for GA takeoffs). **KHPN (Westchester/White Plains)** in NY has voluntary quiet hours (0000–0630) and no Stage 2 jets allowed. **VNY (Van Nuys)** in CA now has a voluntary curfew after 2200 as well to reduce noise.

* **Weight Limits and Special Restrictions**: **Teterboro (KTEB)**, the premier NYC bizav airport, strictly bans aircraft over 100,000 lbs MTOW. The assistant knows a Gulfstream G650 or Global 7500 (which are around 99,000 lbs) are okay, but a Boeing BBJ (170,000 lbs) or Airbus ACJ won’t be allowed. It will advise using alternatives like Morristown or White Plains if someone wanted to bring a heavy bizliner. TEB also has a **voluntary night curfew** (11pm-6am) where operators avoid flying to respect neighbors. The assistant would mention that if a client asks for a 4am TEB departure. Similarly, Aspen **KASE** has a strict aircraft suitability rule (no aircraft with wingspan over 95 feet, etc., and requires special training), plus it’s daylight-only (no night operations) due to terrain. The assistant would highlight those if Aspen comes up.

* **Perimeter Rules**: While not directly a slot issue for private flights, knowledge like **KLGA and KDCA** having perimeter rules (no nonstop flights beyond \~1,250 miles except certain exemptions) might be relevant. For charters, this typically affects Part 121 airlines, but the assistant can note, e.g., *“Reagan National has a 1,250-mile perimeter rule for scheduled flights; however, private charters can be exempt from that with a slot, though often Dulles is easier for coast-to-coast.”* It underscores why sometimes a tech stop or alternate airport is chosen.

* **Weather/ATC Delay Hotspots**: The assistant might also warn that airports like **KSFO (San Francisco)** frequently incur ground delays due to fog, or **KORD/KATL** due to volume and thunderstorms. In planning, it might suggest a bit more buffer time for those. For example, *“Be aware LGA in summer often has ATC GDP delays in afternoons – if you have a tight schedule, Teterboro could be a more reliable option.”*

In essence, Elevate’s airport data ensures the assistant can guide clients around common pitfalls: whether it’s suggesting a more convenient GA airport, advising on curfews (so a late-night departure doesn’t get stuck), or ensuring compliance with special procedures (like security programs or slot bookings for events). By focusing on North America first (as requested), the assistant prioritizes the airports Elevate’s clientele use most and any **critical constraints** that affect the customer experience: noise rules that could alter departure times, weight limits that dictate airport choice, or simply heavy congestion that might warrant an alternate plan. All this helps Elevate’s customers experience smooth travels, with the assistant preemptively addressing constraints rather than reacting to them last-minute. The result is a more informed client who can trust that every detail – from choosing the right airport to scheduling at the right time – has been considered for an optimal private flight experience.
